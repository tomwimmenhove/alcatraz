# Alcatraz

A framework to run parts of a C++ application inside a virtual machine sandbox on x64 processors. The sandboxed code can 'call out' to the host using a set of pre-defined functions.

## Building and running the example
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tomwimmenhove/alcatraz.git
cd alcatraz
make example
```
